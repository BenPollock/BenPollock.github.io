As part of my year 4 capstone project, I created EZ4X (Easy Forex). It's a graphical, automatic forex trader, that uses a user's chosen technical indicators and risk tolerance to automatically execute trades on a currency pair. Simply pick your technical indicators, risk tolerance, and currency pairs, and prepare to beat the market! 

EZ4X provides an evironment for testing trading algorithms using technical indicators, allowing individual investors to experiment and generate real returns.

The application previously used live data and was hosted via heroku, however it is no longer maintained. The source code is still available via <a href="https://github.com/BenPollock/EZ4X">GitHub</a>.
