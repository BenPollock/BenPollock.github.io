After finding a lack of Jewish-themed games on the app stores, I decided to create my own. As part of my year 4 capstone project, I have developed a moblie and web game called “Red Sea Rescue”. In Red Sea Rescue, you play as Moses, running through the split Red Sea as the sea begins to cave in and you avoid obstacles. Obstacles include rocks, coral, sea trenches, and the most annoying of all - fish. Using the accelerometer on your phone, try and get a high score while listening to 8-bit Dayenu!

The project was developed using Unity and was previously available on the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Blackberry App Store. The source code for the web version is available on <a href="https://github.com/BenPollock/RedSeaRescueWeb">GitHub.</a>
